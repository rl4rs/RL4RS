Specifically, we invite the submissions in the area of multi-modal foundational models and resonsibilty but not limited to:

- Multi-modal Foundational Models (Discriminative and Generative) focusing on various modality such as Image / Video / Speech / Language (e.g., MLLMs, T2I or T2A diffusion models, etc.)
- Reliability and security challenges
- Adversarial attacks on multi-modal models
- Training time strategy to ensure responsible behaviour
- Data centric perspective for reliable models
- Ethics, risks, and fairness of multi-modal models
- Various multi-modal training/inference/evaluation efficiency aspects (e.g., handingling large resolution images/videos, long context video understanding, long-horizon high-res video generation) 
- Other responsibility aspects such as memorization, hallucinations, copyright, etc.
- **(Special track) Creating community guidelines for responsible design of next generation of foundational models**
- **(Special track) Position papers on the theme of the workshop**
